# Water Level Indicator

## Overview

The Water Level Indicator is a project initially developed during 8th std to address water scarcity at my grandparent's house. It uses a microcontroller, such as the ESP32, and an ultrasonic module to provide real-time water level readings. The project has evolved from its early versions, which used Arduino and a Bluetooth module, to the current version (V2.0 onwards) that incorporates MQTT for communication due to changes in the Blynk app's payment structure.

## Motivation

The project originated from the need to monitor water levels in a tank situated on the top of my grandparent's house, where accessing the tank was challenging. The initial versions were created in response to water scarcity issues, and the project has since undergone improvements to enhance its functionality and accessibility.

## Features

- **Microcontroller and Sensor:**
  - Utilizes microcontrollers like ESP32 and ultrasonic modules for accurate water level readings.

- **Historical Background:**
  - Originally created in 8th std to address water scarcity for my grandparents.

- **Evolution from V0.1:**
  - Transitioned from Arduino and a Bluetooth module to ESP32 with an inbuilt Wi-Fi module.
  - Incorporated Blynk app for remote monitoring.
  - Introduced MQTT from V2.0 onwards due to changes in Blynk's payment structure.

## Versions

- **V0.1:**
  - Arduino and Bluetooth module used.
  - App created using App Inventor 2.

- **V1.0:**
  - Switched to ESP32 for inbuilt Wi-Fi capability.
  - Blynk app integration for remote monitoring.
    
- **V2.0 Onwards:**
  - Added MQTT for communication.

## Usage

- **Requirements:**
  - ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic module.

- **Setup:**
  - Download the code and upload it to the esp32.
  - Make sure to change the wifi username password and other information in the files
